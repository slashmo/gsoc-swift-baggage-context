// MARK: Context Protocol

/// The `ContextProtocol` MAY be adopted by specific "framework contexts" such as e.g. `CoolFramework.Context` in
/// order to allow users to pass such context directly to libraries accepting any context.
///
/// This allows frameworks and library authors to offer APIs which compose more easily.
/// Please refer to the "Reference Implementation" notes on each of the requirements to know how to implement this protocol correctly.
///
/// ### Implementation notes
/// It is STRONGLY encouraged that a context type should exhibit Value Semantics (i.e. be a pure `struct`, or implement
/// the Copy-on-Write pattern), in order to implement the `set` requirements of the baggage and logger effectively,
/// and also for their user's sanity, as a reference semantics context type can be very confusing to use when shared
/// between multiple threads, as often is the case in server side environments.
///
/// It is STRONGLY encouraged to use the `DefaultContext` as inspiration for a correct implementation of a `Context`,
/// as the relationship between `Logger` and `Baggage` can be tricky to wrap your head around at first.
public protocol Context {
    /// Get the `Baggage` container.
    ///
    /// ### Implementation notes
    /// Libraries and/or frameworks which conform to this protocol with their "Framework Context" types MUST
    /// ensure that a modification of the baggage is properly represented in the associated `logger`. Users expect values
    /// from the baggage be visible in their log statements issued via `context.logger.info()`.
    ///
    /// Please refer to `DefaultContext`'s implementation for a reference implementation,
    /// here a short snippet of how the baggage itself should be implemented:
    ///
    ///     public var baggage: Baggage {
    ///         willSet {
    ///             self._logger.updateMetadata(previous: self.baggage, latest: newValue)
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    /// #### Thread Safety
    /// Implementations / MUST take care of thread-safety of modifications of the baggage. They can achieve this by such
    /// context type being a pure `struct` or by implementing Copy-on-Write semantics for their type, the latter gives
    /// many benefits, allowing the context to avoid being copied unless needed to (e.g. if the context type contains
    /// many other values, in addition to the baggage).
    var baggage: Baggage { get set }

    /// The `Logger` associated with this context carrier.
    ///
    /// It automatically populates the loggers metadata based on the `Baggage` associated with this context object.
    ///
    /// ### Implementation notes
    /// Libraries and/or frameworks which conform to this protocol with their "Framework Context" types,
    /// SHOULD implement this logger by wrapping the "raw" logger associated with  `_logger.with(self.baggage)` function,
    /// which efficiently handles the bridging of baggage to logging metadata values.
    ///
    /// If a new logger is set, it MUST populate itself with the latest (current) baggage of the context,
    /// this is to ensure that even if users set a new logger (completely "fresh") here, the metadata from the baggage
    /// still will properly be logged in other pieces of the application where the context might be passed to.
    ///
    /// A correct implementation might look like the following:
    ///
    ///     public var _logger: Logger
    ///         public var logger: Logger {
    ///             get {
    ///                 return self._logger
    ///             }
    ///             set {
    ///                 self._logger = newValue
    ///                 // Since someone could have completely replaced the logger (not just changed the log level),
    ///                 // we have to update the baggage again, since perhaps the new logger has empty metadata.
    ///                 self._logger.updateMetadata(previous: .topLevel, latest: self.baggage)
    ///             }
    ///         }
    ///     }
    ///
    ///
    /// #### Thread Safety
    /// Implementations MUST ensure the thread-safety of mutating the logger. This is usually handled best by the
    /// framework context itself being a Copy-on-Write type, however the exact safety mechanism is left up to the libraries.
    var logger: Logger { get set }
}

/// A default `Context` type.
///
/// It is a carrier of contextual `Baggage` and related `Logger`, allowing to log and trace throughout a system.
///
/// Any values set on the `baggage` will be made accessible to the logger as call-site metadata, allowing it to log those.
///
/// ### Logged Metadata and Baggage Items
///
/// Please refer to your configured log handler documentation about how to configure which metadata values should be logged
/// and which not, as each log handler may handle and configure those differently. The default implementations log *all*
/// metadata/baggage values present, which often is the right thing, however in larger systems one may want to choose a
/// log handler which allows for configuring these details.
///
/// ### Accepting context types in APIs
///
/// It is preferred to accept values of `ContextProtocol` in library APIs, as this yields a more flexible API shape,
/// to which other libraries/frameworks may pass their specific context objects.
///
/// - SeeAlso: `Baggage` from the Baggage module.
/// - SeeAlso: `Logger` from the SwiftLog package.
public struct DefaultContext: Context {
    /// The `Baggage` carried with this context.
    /// It's values will automatically be made available to the `logger` as metadata when logging.
    ///
    /// Baggage values are different from plain logging metadata in that they are intended to be
    /// carried across process and node boundaries (serialized and deserialized) and are made
    /// available to instruments using `swift-distributed-tracing`.
    public var baggage: Baggage {
        willSet {
            // every time the baggage changes, we need to update the logger;
            // values removed from the baggage are also removed from the logger metadata.
            //
            // TODO: optimally, logger could some day accept baggage directly, without ever having to map it into `Metadata`,
            //       then we would not have to make those mappings at all and passing the logger.with(baggage) would be cheap.
            //
            // This implementation generally is a tradeoff, we bet on logging being performed far more often than baggage
            // being changed; We do this logger update eagerly, so even if we never log anything, the logger has to be updated.
            // Systems which never or rarely log will take the hit for it here. The alternative tradeoff to map lazily as `logger.with(baggage)`
            // is available as well, but users would have to build their own context and specifically make use of that then -- that approach
            // allows to not pay the mapping cost up front, but only if a log statement is made (but then again, the cost is paid every time we log something).
            self._logger.updateMetadata(previous: self.baggage, latest: newValue)
